# TWO DUCKS IN A TRENCHCOAT

Rachel Lim and August Luhrs <br>
for Collective Play <br>
ITP Spring 2019 -- Mimi Yin <br>

===============
Notes 3/21

### To do (roughly):
- Get the rotation stuff working (will hopefully work with Mimi's sketch)
- get the game graphics
- make the actual game (scrolling, score, fail, restart, etc).
- design elements (feedback, text, etc)
- get the chat room stuff working (or abandon that and just stick to
two local players)
- if we can get chat room pairing working, then have a leaderboard screen.



=================

August Notes 3/19
- going to move input/output to one screen so they just open the app and it's auto all there.
  - on connect, we'll have them put their name, and then use the chat room example to auto-sort them
  - then we'll list their names at the bottom so they know who's on their team
  - and have a three second countdown before each round starts
- then if we want we can have a "leaderboard" screen that will list the top scores of each team
- graphics
  - It would be great if the sprite they're controlling looked like a lumpy trenchcoat with duck feet 
  - what scene should they be trying to navigate? what is their goal? they're in a bakery? should there be items they can pick up to boost their score? maybe they're trying to pass as a bakery inspector and collect as much bread as possible, but if they run into any of the bakers running around, then they get knocked over, lose all their bread, and their cover is blown.
  


=================

Brainstorm 3/15
- Two players, one axis 
- One blind?	 No b/c leader and follower
- Non-verbal, just have to figure out how to move as one
- Arcade style elements moving down screen, getting fast as time goes on and they rack up more points
